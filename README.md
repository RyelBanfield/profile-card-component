## My process

### Built with

- [Create R1 App](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-r1-app) - A tool I created to speed up project setup
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Development tool
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling

### What I learned

By building this component, I gained a better understanding of positioning and arbitrary values in TailwindCSS.

### Continued development

In the future I will continue to build out more complex UIs to make styling and layout building almost second nature.
